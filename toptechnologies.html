  <div>
    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">1. Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning</h3>
    <p class="para-font"><span style='color:blue;'>Artificial intelligence(AI)</span> is a branch of computer science which ensures intelligent and efficient machines that can perform variours types of activities including mimicking some of the unique behaviour of Human beings.</p>

    <p class="para-font">Mostly computer systems use a predetermined set of rules and instructions known as an algorithm to do a specific function.But when the concept of AI comes in there we create a general intelligence for a machine by using some different algorithmic technique. By continues training of a AI model with the  training data  , the computer starts to analyse the data which is provided in the given dataset. It creates the ability of self learning and improving by its own experience. This strategy is termed as Machine Learning. </p>

    

    <p class="para-font">In the present AI is completely based on Machine Learning. Machine Learning in simple words training a machine using some stratergies and provide them the ability to learn and improve by its own experience. This provides intelligence for machines to do some tasks as well as interacting with human beings.We are familier with some of virtual assistants like <span style="color: blue;">Google Assistant(Google) , Siri(Apple) , Alexa(Amazon) , Cortana(Microsoft)</span> etc. These are intelligent systems which can talk to human beings. They use various types of methods like Speech Recognition,Deep Learning,Natural Language Processing(NLP),Translation etc to communicate with us. Moreover These Virtual Assistants can do a lot of things for us like answering questions,telling jokes,making remainders etc. These are all done using Machine Learning. Infact ML is a booming technology not only in the IT field but in the medical and business fields because it can predict the output of different types of medicines and helps in making new drugs. Also it can be used in <span style="color: blue;">Clinical Decision Support(CDS)</span> which helps in assisting health care providers. In business areas ML can be useful to extract consumer data and can build customer profiles. Also business mans can build chatbots which is able to interact with customers so as to handle a large number of customers at the same time these chatbots are realy useful and the customers didn't feel like they are talking with a software.</p>

    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">2. Quantum Computing</h3>

    

    <p class="para-font"><span style='color:blue;'>Quantum computing</span> is a fifth generation computing method which uses quantum phenomena for the processing of data and instructions. A <span style="color: blue;">"quantum"</span> is a latin word which simply means the smallest possible unit of a physical object like electrons , photons , quarks etc. By exploiting the properties of these quanta objects it is possible to create a computer system which is millions to billion times faster and efficient than all the modern supercomputers in the world. This computer  is known as a <span style="color: blue;">Qunatum Computer.</span>A quantum computer can perform millions of computations at once. This rate is much higher than the processing speed of all the classical computers we have. The reason behind the speed of a quantum computer is because each of the binary digits are in <span style="color: blue;">Superposition</span> state. In classical computers we consider bits as the smallest storage unit but in quantum computers the smallest storage unit is called <span style="color: blue;">Qubits.</span>Each of these qubit stands in a superposition state in which each qubit contains both True(1) and False(0) values at the same time. This property of a quanta objects provides a quantum computer speed and efficieny than classical computers. </p>

  <div>
    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">3. Cloud Computing</h3>


    <p class="para-font">The purpose of <span style='color:blue;'>Cloud Computing</span> is to store , process and manage different types of data in seperate remote servers over the internet rather than using any local server or personal computer. The data processing speed on a cloud server is much faster than the data processing speed in local servers and personal computers and the amount of data can be stored  in these computers are limited by a small amount , but the cloud server has larger storage capacity and performance. More over this cloud providers also provide software services , for example google sheets is a cloud software which works exactly like the ordinary excel software without actually installing it in the system. It is believed that in coming days most of the data is work on cloud rather than local servers and it is possible to use all kind of heavy softwares like high end graphic games , video rendering softwares etc without extreme hardware specification.  Some of best cloud providers are Amazon Web Service(AWS) , Microsoft Azure , Google Cloud , IBM Cloud etc.   </p>
  </div><br>


  <div>
    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">4. Blockchain</h3>

    



    <p class="para-font"><span style='color:blue;'>Blockchain</span> is a decentralized and distributed technology which contains various data and information stored in certain chain of blocks which can never be owned or controlled by any centralized authority. The blockchain technology ensures security , trust and distribution of data. Each of the participans in the blockchain do have the records of the secured data and it is known as a ledger. But how the security is being ensured when it is distributed among all? is it easy to tamper the data? the simple answer is 'No' because there we have the concept of <span style="color: blue">Hashing</span>. Hashing is the technique of converting any type of data into a certain form of bits called a hashed key. This key stores the hashed data that is almost impossible to retrieve back.So if any one tries to change the data we can identify it.</p>
  </div><br>


  <div>
    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">5. Big data</h3>

   

    <p class="para-font">Data is the most vital thing for the technology to develop. The amount of data is increasing year by year over the internet and 90% of these data is generated in the past two years. So data is produced everywhere in the world and the management of this data itself is important. <span style="color: blue;">Big Data</span> is the field that provides the way to analyse , manage and extract huge amount of data and information. In earlier times the tech companies , buisness companies , banks , hospitals etc  only generate and work with data but in present every common internet user have their own data. For example Facebook has around 3 billion users all over the world and each of them have their own data as text , images , videos etc so it is very important to store and process these huge amount of data in an efficient manner in which the user never fails to store and fetch data from facebook or any other platform or website. There comes the significance of Data mining or Big Data and every large companies need their own data experts for analysing and managing data.</p>
  </div><br>


  <div>
    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">6. Internet Of Things(IOT)</h3>

    <p class="para-font">One of the best technology in the fucture is the <span style ='color:blue;'>IOT or Internet of Things</span> which enables all electronic devices which contain sensors and softwares connect to internet which facilitate to transfer and recieve data and provides control over these devices with the help of internet from any where in the world. By linking all the electronic objects to internet it provides the ability to control these devices with in a single command itself. Self driving cars is the best example for IOT which uses various stratergies like Machine Learning , Deep Learning , Computer vision etc to make it more smarter. The system inside the car always send and recieve messages from the cloud with the help of 24 hours high band-width internet connection. These computers have large number of sensors and a software to communicate with the cloud with a certain ip address , so if there is any obstacle comes infront of the car it can detect it and can respond quickly. Not only IOT is applicable in self driving cars , but also we can operate any electronic devices which has a valid internet connection. But infact implementation of IOT also have some drawbacks like <span style="color: blue;">Security</span>. If all the systems are connected to internet there lacks the security in which anyone can easily access to someones personal information and can perform malicious activities because in a particular company or home all these systems are connected with the same ip address. </p>
  </div><br>



  <div>
    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">7. DevOps</h3>


    

    <p class="para-font"><span style='color:blue;'>DevOps</span> is basically a combination of <span style="color: blue;">Development</span> and <span style="color: blue;">Operation</span> which is not actually a technology or tool but a culture which helps to implement the technology in an scalable and efficient way. For the construction of every large scale software application there are two particular teams work behind called the development team and operation team. Development team is responsible for writing code , develop new features , software testing etc and the operation team is responsible of server configuration , data backup , scaling issues , ensuring security etc. But in case of bugs occurs in the application it is not that much easy to manage if there is no sync between the development team and operation team. There come the concept of DevOps in which every person in the development and operation team should work together for the good production level.</p>
  </div><br>


  <div>
    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">8. Virtual reality(VR) & Augmented reality(AR)</h3>
    <p class="para-font"><span style='color:blue;'>Virtual reality</span> and <span style="color: blue;">Augmented reality</span> is a technology which is build using computer generated simulations. Virtual reality is one of the computer-generated simulation in which a person using this technology can experience a different three-dimensional virtual world which is entirely different from real world scenario. Currently we are using VR headsets to generate realistic images , sounds and sensations to increase the user experience. Some of the applications of virtual reality include video games , movies , animation cartoons etc and it can be also applicable in visualised learning. On the other hand Augmented reality is an interactive experience of the real world where the objects in the real world are enhanced by computer simulations. It is possible to embed virtual objects and detect real life objects through a computer screen using AR and the virtual object that we created using AR is exactly look like a real life object in the real world. Some applications of augmented reality includes design and modeling , entertainment purposes , classroom lecture etc.</p>

  <div>
    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">9. Genetic Engineering</h3>
    <p class="para-font">Apart from all other technologies <span style="color: blue;">Genetic Engineering</span> is a biological term which is the the study about genomes in different types of organisms which helps to change and alter the genetic pattern of cells , It is also known as <span style="color: blue;">genetic modification</span>. Genetic modification simply means editing or changing genes in DNA of different  types of organisms including humans.<span style="color: blue;"> DNA short for deoxyribonucleic acid</span> is the genetic code or data of all the living organisms , it decide all the characteristics of living organisms including their shape , size , color , living condition etc and moreover it contains all the instructions needed for a organism to survive , reproduce , develop and son on. So genetic engineering is simply editing these DNA patterns or creating new DNA patterns to change the characteristics of living organisms. Through genetic engineering or gene editing it is possible to cure the genetic disorders and abnormalities in humans beings results in a healthy human era.</p>

  <div>
    <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">10. 5G</h3>
  


    <p class="para-font"><span style="color: blue;">5G</span> is the fifth generation technology for broadband cellular networks. 3G and 4G were the greatest technologies allow us to browse over the internet , download data from internet , watching movies and so on. But 5G services will be a revolutionary technology which helps to explore more in the world of internet. On the arrival of 5G , most of the services move towards the cloud. Why because the data can be easily accessed and manipulated using cloud servers and 5G network.   </p>
